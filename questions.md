### Questions
1. Where should I be putting my margin and padding? Here I've just used margin bottom on each element to define the
vertical spacing but I'm not sure if that's the best way to do it. Ideally I would like to define a vertical margin
variable and be able to control it globally somewhere. Is that done (or good/bad practice) in CSS?
2. I've used a lot of divs and classes here, is that okay?
3. The padding on my tag class feels messy. Could I have done this any cleaner?
4. I've used the font weights (600, 800) and size (16px) given in the style guide but it doesn't look quite right. Have
I done something wrong?
